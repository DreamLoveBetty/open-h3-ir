r"""The upload store: bytes a caller sent, kept under the name their own content gives them.

Attachments used to reach this service one way only, as a path it opened off its own filesystem.
That works when the caller and the service see one disk and it cannot be made to work otherwise:
ComfyUI on one machine pointed at a service on another has no spelling of C:\ComfyUI\temp\ref.png
the service can open, because a path is not a file. This module is the other way in, for the caller
that has the bytes and no shared disk.

Three decisions hold it together, and each one is load-bearing rather than tidy.

**A stored file is named by the digest THIS PROCESS computed, never by the one the caller claimed.**
The caller names its PUT with a sha256 so the transfer can be skipped when we already hold those
bytes, but that name never reaches the filesystem. The bytes are streamed through hashlib into a
temporary file, the digest is compared with the claim, and the file is placed under the digest we
computed. So the path is derived from content we hashed ourselves, and a name meant to escape the
store, a traversal or an absolute path or a device file, never gets that far: the only shape accepted
here is 64 lowercase hex characters.

**Content addressing rather than an upload id.** The service already keys everything by sha256:
asset cards, the transcript map, the wiring manifest, the node's own slot bindings. An upload id
would be a second name for a thing that already has one, and it would break the property that makes
a big file bearable: re-queueing a graph whose clip has not changed sends no bytes at all, because
the digest is the same and the store already answers to it.

**Both ceilings are enforced against bytes actually received.** `Content-Length` is a claim: it is
absent under chunked encoding and it can simply be wrong. It is used to refuse early and to reserve
room, and never as the measurement. The count that stops a write is the one this module accumulated.

Nothing here ever serves bytes back out. The store is write-and-analyse, not a file server: a read
endpoint would turn any service on a network into an anonymous drop box that hands the drop back.
