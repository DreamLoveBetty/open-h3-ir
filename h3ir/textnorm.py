"""Byte hygiene for model output.

The IR is tokenized verbatim, so a curly apostrophe is not a cosmetic difference -- it is a
different token sequence. Models emit them constantly (the first end-to-end run produced
U+2019 in "dragon's"), so every model output is normalised at the boundary rather than
policed later.

Applied ONLY to generated prose. User dialogue and quoted on-screen text are inserted by the
template after this point and must stay byte-exact, whatever they contain.
