"""The creativity dial: how much the writer may add beyond what was asked.

The owner's bar for the service is four parts -- *directed* (a reason behind every choice),
*proportionate* (a plain ask gets a plain result, an ambitious ask gets an ambitious result),
*complete* (everything H3 expects, populated meaningfully), and *valid*. This module owns
proportionality.

It is an explicit input, not an inference. Reading ambition out of the request -- its length, its
specificity, words like "epic" versus "simple" -- was considered and dropped: it would be wrong
often and, worse, there would be no way to overrule it. A dial is honest. Set restrained, get
restrained.

**The axis is addition, not effort.** The dial does not mean "more shots" or "more camera moves" --
that is the taste-as-mechanics trap the rule audit removed from the validator, and it would put shot
count back in through a side door. What the dial governs is whether the writer may introduce
*content the request never supplied*: words for a character to speak, music for the audience, text
burned into the frame. Those three are decidable, and each carries information that came from
nowhere but the model.

Deliberately NOT on the dial, at any position:
  * shot count and where the cuts fall -- a director's call, never a defect;
  * the camera -- H3 requires a stated camera at every position (P4/P5), so "restrained" means the
    plainest move the request supports, never an unstated one;
  * how good the prose is -- not the validator's business at any setting.

This mirrors `licence.py`, which is the owner's settled rule for reference plates: the plate governs
any attribute the request does not explicitly speak to. Here the request governs, and the dial says
what the writer may do where the request is silent. Same shape, different source of authority.

#
# MAGNITUDE: not what may be added, but how far every decision is pushed. The dial's two axes move
# together under one control because the interface takes no clutter; they are separable in principle
# and `Scope` keeps them as separate properties so a second control is a later change here and
# nowhere else.
#
# **What magnitude governs: VALUES. What it never governs: COUNTS.** Amplitude, speed, motion type,
# framing, contrast, how completely a beat resolves -- all values, all how strongly one shot is
# played. How many shots and where the cuts fall are counts, they stay off the dial at every
# position, and "at extreme, where it is choosing between N and N+1 shots, take N+1" was declined
# for that reason: shot count is a director's call and the moment a setting licenses more of them it
# is a rule about shot count again, one layer above the validator where nothing catches it.
#
# The axis is the spec's own. base-en.txt 4.3 defines camera motion as motion type + **amplitude** +
# **speed**, with `with small|large amplitude` and `at slow|fast speed` as the values and the note
# that medium and normal are the omitted defaults. So "the far end" is a set of values the format
# already names -- which is what makes this position checkable rather than a matter of opinion.

MAXIMAL_CAMERA = ("with large amplitude", "at fast speed")
# `TIMID_CAMERA` -- the small/slow end -- lived here for the rule that forbade it at `extreme`. It went
# with the rule and is deliberately NOT reintroduced: nothing in this system needs to recognise a quiet
# camera move, because no setting objects to one.

# THE DIAL IS DELIBERATELY ASYMMETRIC. This is the design, not a gap, and the next person to measure
# it will want to file it as one -- so it is written down here rather than in a doc nobody opens.
#
#   restrained   ENFORCED. Q2 rejects an addition the setting does not license. A hard floor.
#   balanced     soft. An instruction that leans. Nothing verifies it.
#   bold         soft. An instruction that leans harder. Nothing verifies it.
#   extreme      ENFORCED. Q3 asserts the closed vocabulary appears. A hard ceiling.
#
# So `balanced` and `bold` are indistinguishable in some outputs BY DESIGN. That was measured and
# reported as a finding -- 0 maximal camera values at restrained, balanced and bold alike -- and the
# owner's answer was to narrow the position rather than enforce it: "bold just means if a little nudge
# can do it, don't mechanically enforce it". A nudge that sometimes moves nothing is still a nudge, and
# a model declining it on a given request is an acceptable outcome rather than a failure.
#
# A check for `bold` was built and REMOVED on that instruction. Do not re-add one. If bold's nudge is
# landing too rarely, the lever is the wording in `brief_instruction`, never a rule.
#
#   maximal   at least one maximal value must appear (Q3). Nothing forbids a quiet one.
#
# There is no rule forbidding `with small amplitude` / `at slow speed` at `extreme`, and that is a
# decision rather than an omission. One existed (Q4-extreme-not-committed) and the owner removed it
# when the choice was put to him as everything-maxed-with-no-exceptions versus mostly-maxed-with-
# contrast-allowed. His reason is the thing that would make someone re-add it, so it is written here:
#
#   HOLD, HOLD, THEN HIT is how a lot of real direction works. A setting that forbids the hold cannot
#   express the hit.
#
# `extreme` still has to REACH for big and fast -- Q3 sees to that -- it just does not have to be
# uniformly loud. Do not add a uniformity rule here.
