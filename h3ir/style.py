"""Style resolution. The policy is set by licence.py; this module only renders it.

**The reference governs the medium unless the request explicitly asks for a transformation.** A
bare adjective ("anime style, cinematic") is not a transformation -- see licence.py for the
owner's reasoning, which is drift: a throwaway word must not be able to override an observed
plate, or a character drifts between shots according to how carelessly each request was worded.

I previously had this the other way round and was wrong. The argument I made -- that silently
ignoring a stated instruction is undiagnosable -- only holds if the word was deliberate.
"Reimagine as" is deliberate; "anime style" dropped into a shot description is not.
