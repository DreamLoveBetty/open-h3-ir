# Calling the API

This is the document for whoever drives the compiler: an application, a UI, or an agent that knows
nothing about H3. It says what the service promises, what it only attempts, and which of those you
can safely build a screen or a workflow on.

If you are changing the compiler itself, you want [../AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) instead. If your caller
is ComfyUI, the client is already written: [../comfyui/README.md](../comfyui/README.md) is the node
pack, and [`../comfyui/h3ir_client.py`](../comfyui/h3ir_client.py) is a worked example of this API
consumed over the standard library alone, with every failure branch below turned into a sentence for a
person to read.

## In one line

You send a plain-language request and some files. You get back a validated H3 brief **and the asset
wiring that brief is true for**. Nothing else in your system has to understand H3's format.

## Routes

| method | path | what it does |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/health` | liveness |
| `GET` | `/v1/capabilities` | legal durations, aspects, asset limits, dialogue languages, output geometry |
| `POST` | `/v1/briefs` | compile. `201` with the brief, `422` if the request cannot be honoured as stated |
| `GET` | `/v1/briefs/{id}` | fetch a compiled brief again |
| `PATCH` | `/v1/briefs/{id}` | refine in plain language: `{"change":"make it darker"}` → `200`, new version |
| `GET` | `/v1/briefs/{id}/prompt` | the prompt text alone |
| `GET` | `/v1/loras` | available styles, by id and prose |
| `GET` | `/v1/directors` | the seven shipped profiles in full, the twenty camera moves, and what a profile governs |
| `GET` | `/v1/directors/{id}` | one profile. `404` names the listing route |
| `PUT` | `/v1/assets/{sha256}` | send one attachment's bytes. `201` when stored, `422` when the bytes do not hash to the name |

The only required field is `intent`. Everything else has a defensible default.

## Sending the files

Every attachment says where its bytes are, one way or the other, and never both. `path` is a path on
the service's own host: nothing is copied, and the bytes the brief is written about are the bytes you
already had. `sha256` names an attachment you have already sent to `PUT /v1/assets/{sha256}`, which is
the way in when you and the service do not share a filesystem. Both at once is refused rather than one
quietly winning, because they can disagree and a request that says two things about which file it means
renders something plausible about the wrong one.

A clip whose soundtrack travels with it has a second field, `paired_video_sha256`, naming the clip that
sound belongs to, so the pairing survives when both arrive as uploads rather than as paths.

The upload is one `PUT` with the raw bytes as the body, and the name in the URL is the sha256 the
service computes as they arrive. Nothing else about the request matters. That name is why a second
render of the same graph sends nothing: the store already holds those bytes. If you name a digest the
service does not hold, `POST /v1/briefs` answers `422` with `code: asset-not-uploaded` and a `missing`
list of exactly the digests to send, so the correct reaction is to upload those and ask once more.

Assets are write-only. `GET`, `HEAD`, `DELETE`, `POST` and `PATCH` on one all answer `405`, so nothing
you send can be read back out of the service by anyone who knows a hash.

Four ceilings, published in the `assets` block of `GET /v1/capabilities` so you read them rather than
copy them: `upload_max_bytes` is 512 MiB for one file, `upload_store_bytes` is 8 GiB for the whole
store, `upload_ttl_hours` is 48, and the store drops the least recently used first when it fills. An
upload that worked an hour ago can therefore need sending again, which the `422` above says out loud.
The same block carries `paths`, which is `false` on a service that has filesystem reads switched off.

**Two facts for whoever runs it, rather than whoever calls it.** `h3ir serve` binds `0.0.0.0`, so it is
reachable from the network the moment it starts; pass `--host 127.0.0.1` if that is not what you meant.
And a `path` is read with the service's own permissions, with the file's contents then described in the
brief, which on a reachable service is a way to read files off that host. `H3IR_ALLOW_ASSET_PATHS=0`
turns path reads off entirely and leaves uploads as the only way in. Both settings and the reason for
each are in [`../.env.example`](../.env.example).

## Mode selection is never the user's problem

T2VA, I2VA, FL2VA, L2VA and Ref2VA are inferred from what is attached, because the wiring is the
only thing that can decide them correctly. **No screen should ever ask.** It fails safe toward
Ref2VA, and not because Ref2VA is a favourite. It is strictly more expressive than FL2VA, so
choosing it cannot lose a capability the request needed.

## The creativity dial

One control, four named positions, default `balanced`. **A person understands these words; a 0.0 to
1.0 slider does not, which is why it is named rather than numeric.**

| position | what it licenses beyond the request |
|---|---|
| `restrained` | nothing |
| **`balanced`** (default) | a score for the audience |
| `bold` | a score, a spoken line, text visible in the frame |
| `extreme` | the same three, plus every decision played at the far end of what the format supports |

Three things a surface must not get wrong about it:

- **It is content licence, not effort.** A higher setting does not mean more shots or more camera
  moves. It means the writer *may* introduce things the request never mentioned.
- **An explicit prohibition in the request beats every setting.** "No dialogue" at `extreme` still
  means no dialogue.
- **The middle two positions are deliberately soft.** `bold` is a nudge. If it does not visibly
  change an output, that is the design. Do not build a UI that promises a visible difference at
  every step.

## Who is directing

Optional, and off unless you send it. Two fields on `POST /v1/briefs`: `director` names one of the
seven this build ships, by id, and `director_profile` is `{"name": ..., "notes": ...}` carrying one
your user wrote. Send neither and the writing behaves exactly as it always has, which is the default
every existing caller already gets. Send both and a recognised `director` id wins; the profile you
sent is used only when the id names nothing this build has.

**A profile is prose, not a schema.** `notes` is a paragraph in ordinary language: what the camera
does, how tight the framing is and from what height, what the light and the colour are like, what the
frame spends its attention on, how bodies move and how lines are delivered, what the room sounds like
and what a score would be made of. There are no axes to fill in and no vocabulary to conform to. It is
steered, not enforced: nothing narrows a rotation, suppresses a sentence or refuses a word.

`name` is what the report and the record call it, and it is **never sent to the writer**. Naming a
director to a model is the shortest path to getting that director's famous shots back instead of a way
of working, so the habits do the work and the name stays on your side of the wire.

Four things a surface must not get wrong about it:

- **It fills the residual, and only the residual.** The compiler resolves every attribute to your
  request or to a reference first, states that resolution in the ask, and places the profile
  underneath it. Write "a locked-off wide" and you get a locked-off wide whoever is directing, while
  the light and the sound are still theirs.
- **It never sets how many shots there are or where they cut.** Pin `shots` and the count is your
  contract, enforced. Leave it unset and the writer decides the edit, exactly as it does with no
  profile at all. A UI that presents direction as an editing control is promising something this
  layer deliberately cannot do.
- **An unknown `director` id does not fail the render.** It falls back to no direction and says so as
  a `WARN` finding, `N2-director-unknown`, naming the word that missed. A saved script pinned to an
  id that has since been removed is told rather than quietly compiled with no direction at all. A
  profile with a name and an empty `notes` is inert rather than invalid, and says so as
  `N1-director-empty`.
- **The one refusal is length.** A `notes` over 5,000 characters is a `422` with
  `code: director-profile-invalid`, because all of it rides in the ask on every call and a pasted
  document crowds out the request itself. That number is not in `GET /v1/capabilities` today, so a
  client that wants to say it before the round trip has to copy it. It is the one ceiling in this API
  you cannot read back, and the ComfyUI panel copies it for exactly that reason.

`GET /v1/directors` returns the seven in full, the twenty camera-move names H3 recognises, and one
sentence saying what a profile governs, so a surface can show somebody a real paragraph to start from
and edit rather than a menu of names that select something invisible.

## What it guarantees, and is safe to build on

- **The manifest is the contract.** Every label in the brief has an asset behind it, and every asset
  has a label in the brief. An empty manifest means attach nothing.
- **The caller's words are never rewritten.** Dialogue is byte-exact and does not pass through a
  model.
- **Duration lands on H3's frame grid**, and every cut time falls inside the clip.
- **Every section H3 expects is present, in order, and non-empty.**
- **An explicit prohibition is never violated.**
- **You get a valid brief or an error, never a quietly degraded one.** If the writing model is
  unavailable or its output fails verification, the deterministic draft ships and the response says
  so in a field you can read (`source`, `fallback_reason`).
- **Nothing describes audio it has not heard.** No component here can hear. A transcript you supply
  provides the words; you supply the rest.

## What it only attempts, so do not build a promise on these

- **That the writing is good.** The validator has no access to whether a brief is well directed.
- **That length lands in the spec's band.** Reported, never enforced, and in practice briefs come
  out under the band more often than in it. The warning tells you when.
- **That a dial step visibly changes the output.** True at `extreme`, deliberately not guaranteed in
  the middle.
- **That the shot count is anything in particular.** One shot for eight seconds is a legitimate
  answer.
- **That a person's identity survives the render.** The brief binds the reference and states what
  must be preserved; whether the model delivers is a render outcome. The hardest case is `extreme`,
  which reaches for extreme close-ups. **This is the promise most likely to be assumed wrongly by
  someone designing screens.**

## What comes back

Three layers. A UI should read the first two and never the third.

- **`presentation`**: plain language, the request as asked, the setting used, the style, the shots
  with what happens in each, who speaks, the sound. No labels, no markers, no field names, and no
  mode names ever.
- **`findings`**: each severity-tagged. `ERROR` blocks; `WARN` and `INFO` are for display.
- **`ir`**: the brief itself plus the manifest, for whoever wires the render graph.

## Limits worth designing around

- **Audio references need you to describe the sound.** A transcript gives the words only. Timbre,
  delivery and tempo have to be stated, or the reference contributes nothing, and the response says
  so. This matters more than it looks: H3's tokenizer emits `"<Audio j>: "` and no content, so the
  brief's text is the encoder's only channel for what that audio is. An invented timbre is actively
  harmful rather than merely useless, which is why nothing here will invent one.
- **Video references are read from three sampled frames**, at 10/50/90% of the clip, not the whole
  thing. `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` are hard runtime requirements for video references, not
  conveniences; the analyser raises rather than producing a card it cannot support.
- **A single run is not a measurement.** Nothing about the writing model is deterministic enough
  that one output proves a path is sound.
- **The asset ceilings are the runtime's sockets, not a policy.** Nine images, three videos, three
  standalone audios, and a soundtrack for each of those videos, which is eighteen files at the
  absolute maximum. Over capacity is a `422` naming what to drop, never a manifest that publishes a
  socket the graph does not have. `GET /v1/capabilities` reports all four numbers, so read them rather
  than copying them into your client.
