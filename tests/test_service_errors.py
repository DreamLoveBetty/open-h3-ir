"""What the HTTP surface says when something the caller can act on goes wrong. No model, no GPU.

`analyse.py` writes its refusals for a person to read -- which file, what is wrong with it, what to
install -- and nothing on the way out caught them. `create_brief` handled `BackendUnavailable` and
`BackendError` only, so every `AssetAnalysisError` became `Internal Server Error` with an empty
body: a corrupt clip, a still attached as `kind: video`, and a machine without ffmpeg all landed
there, and all three messages were discarded.

The two are separated because the answers differ. An unreadable or mis-declared file is the
caller's to fix (422). A missing ffmpeg is this deployment's, and no request they can send will
help (503) -- which is why it is a subclass rather than a phrase in the message.
