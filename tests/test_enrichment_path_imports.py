"""The additive path raised `NameError` on entry and 680 green tests did not notice.

`prose.beat_sheet` and `prose.shot_body` both interpolated `{dial}` into their ask while the
surrounding code defined `dlg`. Both raise on the statement that builds the ask, before any model is
called. They are reachable only through `compile_brief(write_first=False)`, a default-True parameter
that neither `service.create_brief` nor the CLI ever sets, so the branch is unreachable in production
and the bug was latent -- and unreachable code is exactly what no test exercised.

Leaving a `NameError` behind a flag is the shape that bites whoever next adds a caller, so the name is
fixed and these two tests are the ones that would have caught it: they call each function with a
backend that records the ask and returns a minimal well-formed reply. No model, no GPU.
