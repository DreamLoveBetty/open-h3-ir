"""Every declared role has to survive its own renderer. No model and no GPU.

`Role` is the input the whole layer derives from: task types, retention markers and the
subject-definition wording all come off it. Every value is accepted at the API boundary, and
until now the suite exercised most of them only through hand-written documents that a test wrote
and then validated. That proves the RULE and never proves the renderer obeys it, which is how
`role: "sfx"` shipped as a hard 500 on first use: `plan._AUDIO_MARKER` wrote `partially_copy` and
R22 forbids exactly that marker for a role whose definition is "the signal is referenced, not
copied". The deterministic draft is our own output, so an ERROR in it raises rather than falling
back -- the caller got HTTP 500 with an empty body.

So this file renders, and validates what it rendered. Nothing here writes a document by hand.
