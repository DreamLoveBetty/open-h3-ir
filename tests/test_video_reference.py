"""Video references: real frames, or a loud failure.

Nothing produced frames before this. `analyse_video` accepted a frame list and every caller passed
none, so it fell through to `[ref.path]` -- handing a vision model the `.mp4` itself, base64'd into an
`image_url` field. The model received a video blob where an image belongs and returned a card with the
right shape describing nothing in particular. Silent in both directions: no exception, no validator
error, and a compiler perfectly willing to build a brief on it.

These tests need ffmpeg, which is now a hard runtime dependency of video references rather than a
convenience. A skip here means the feature cannot work on this machine, so the skip says so.
