"""Facts the file itself carries, read instead of guessed. No model and no GPU.

`AssetRef.px` was populated in exactly one place in the whole codebase -- `evalloop/suite.py`, the
eval suite, from literals. The service, the CLI and the node all left it None, so everything
downstream took its fallback branch:

  * `plan.rows_for_image` returned the canvas figure for every reference regardless of its real
    size, so `sizing: "max"` and `sizing: "match"` published the same row cost for the same plate.
    A caller could not see the cost of the one knob they had turned, and README's cost claim rests
    on that number.
  * `mode.infer_mode`'s aspect-mismatch downgrade reads `a.px`, so it could never fire -- which was
    the only deterministic route to `status: needs_input`.

And the declared kind was equally unchecked: an mp4 attached as `kind: image` travelled to the
vision endpoint and came back as `HTTP 400: Failed to load image: cannot identify image file
<_io.BytesIO object>`, forwarded to the caller as a 502 with the inference server's internals in it.

The header reader is stdlib only. This package's runtime dependencies are fastapi, uvicorn,
pydantic, httpx and tiktoken, and one number per image does not earn Pillow.
