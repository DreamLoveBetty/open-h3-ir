"""An audio card is 100% caller-supplied metadata, so caching it by content hash loses the caller.

Found by re-firing row 31 against the live service after the transcript was plumbed through to the
composer: the words still did not reach `<d>` in any of 7 runs, and the reason was upstream of every
change. `analyse_all` consults the card cache first, the key is
`sha256 | ANALYZER_VERSION | model | kind`, and for audio the card contains nothing derived from the
bytes at all -- `analyse_audio` makes no model call by design, because nothing here can hear. Every
field in it comes from the request:

    role      -> the summary sentence ("a spoken vocal reference supplying voice timbre")
    note      -> `characterisation`, the ONLY channel the encoder has for what the audio sounds like
    transcript-> the words, supplied by the caller's own recogniser
    seconds   -> the duration

None of those is in the key. So the first request that attached a wav saved a card, and every later
request attaching the SAME wav with a different note, a different role, or a transcript got the first
request's card back. The live cache entry for the probe's `aud_voice.wav` held `transcript: ''` and a
note from a different request entirely ("a low, slow, slightly hoarse female voice" against a request
that said "a flat male voice, close mic"), and that is what reached the writer.

Caching it bought nothing either: there is no model call and no file read to save. So audio is not
cached, in both directions.
