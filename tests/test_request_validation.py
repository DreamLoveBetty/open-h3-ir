"""The request fields a caller can make meaningless. No model and no GPU.

None of the three was checked. `intent: ""` compiled a full brief about nothing. `seconds: 0.0`
returned `ready` with a five-frame, 0.208-second render. `seconds: 1.0` silently became 1.625s, a
62% change, reported only as an INFO about the trained band. And an `aspect` that is not a ratio
reached `grid.canvas_for_aspect`, where the unpack raised ValueError and the caller got a 500.

What is deliberately NOT refused is an unusual ratio. `/v1/capabilities` lists six aspects and the
runtime takes any canvas that is a multiple of 32, so `7:5` is a legal request; refusing it would
repeat the mistake the capacity work just corrected, of reading a published list as a ceiling.
